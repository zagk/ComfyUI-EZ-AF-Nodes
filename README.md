## File Loader Nodes
Custom UI File Loader nodes allows visually pleasing and intuitive selection of prompts, tags or rows of CSV file.
Loader nodes can output single or multiple texts based on mode, as well as randomize selection or batch/list all selected items.
Loader nodes keep selections on workflow load or page refresh.

### Selection modes:
- single: Select one item at a time. Output 1 item at a time.
- multiple: Select multiple items. Output will be concatenated with a comma.
- random: Randomly select one item from selection on each prompt queue. If selection is empty Can be controlled by an optional seed input. In that case node will not re-execute when seed is fixed.

### File Structure
Files are loaded from directories and subdirectories within `comfyui-ez-af-nodes/data` folder, populate these directories with your custom presets as you like.

```
comfyui-ez-af-nodes/data
├── PROMPTS/          # For prompt text files
├── THUMBNAILS/       # For thumbnails
├── CSV/              # For CSV data files  
└── TAGS/             # For tag files
```

Dynamic input node. Allows selection of a single input in 1 of 3 scenarios:
- **by index**: Select input by specified index
- **by random**: Choose a random input each time. Always re-executes unless opt_seed input is connected.
- **automatic**: Output the first input that is not None

> [!WARNING]
> This node uses "ANY" type for both inputs and output, allowing it to pass anything, including models, images, latents, etc.
> This node doesn't do any processing with inputs, so if you try to pass its output to a node that does not expect certain type, you will get an error.

## **EZ Extract Prompt**

Extracts width and height values from text strings (always uses the last 2 found numbers as size).

## **Other Text Utilities**
You may find more nodes that do basic things like find & replace or input string, i keep them for myself for testing purposes, i recommend using built-in comfy core nodes instead
